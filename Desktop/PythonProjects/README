As i mentioned this python script is created for raspberry pi 3. 
I am running this currently on my own device and soon i will attach it to the wall so i can access it's features daily and easily.
I hope you enjoy the little script, and feel free to play around witht the code. 
Functionality can easily be added since the script is created for that exact purpose.
